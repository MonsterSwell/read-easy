## Instructions

Build a VS Code extension and push it to a public repo on GitHub that we can review. There's an example below, but you can ignore it and do your own thing if you want!

If you don't use the provided example, try to make something which offers some modest utility, not "it rains confetti in my editor when I type."


## Example

Build an extension that shows information about the complexity of their English-language writing. The text-readability package can score English text on a variety of complexity scales.

You have the creative freedom to decide:

Exactly what information should be displayed?
When and where should the information appear, and in what form?
Interaction model: is the extension triggered? Does it passively observe in the background?

VS Code offers a variety of ways to extend the workbench: status bar items, tree views, highlights. There are numerous VS Code extension samples that you can use as a starting point or mine for reuse.

## Do's and Don'ts

* âœ… Do have a complete, working thing even if the functionality is modest.
* âœ… Do be ready to share your screen and talk about the code you wrote.
* ðŸš« Do not publish the extension to the VS Code marketplace, unless you want to.
* ðŸš« Do not stress out about making something amazing.
* ðŸš« Do not worry about code quality and polish. Code written in a short amount of time will look like it, and that's perfectly okay!
